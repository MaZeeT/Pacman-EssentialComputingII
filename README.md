# Essential Computing II
This is my group submission of the "Essential Computing II" course exam project from RUC (Roskilde University).
A description of the course can be found in MainCourseDescription.pdf and a description of the project can be found in CourseDescription.pdf

In this submission I build a pacman game where each of the ghosts is controlled by a different algorithm. The algorithm used is based on breathfirst and depthfirst maze algorithms. The last algorithm is a greedy one that try to minimize the distant to the target.
